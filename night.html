    <p>i love watching <strong>shows</strong>, esp before bed! <br> 
      like movies, kdramas & cdramas. one of my fav movie (& book) series would be harry potter, <br>
      and the most recent show i watched was singles inferno (lol) <br>

    <p>i also enjoy <strong>reading</strong>! <br> my fav genre would probably be fantasy - i really like the six of crows duology <br>
      random fun fact: i won an award in primary school for reading the most books in a year
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class = 'row'>
    <p>this isn't exactly a night thing, but i really like watching <strong>sunsets</strong>! <br>
      all the photos i've used here are sunset photos that i've taken - the background of this page was taken on an airplane!
